# TypeScript & Redux Kanban Board

A quick exercise in TypeScript with Redux state-management.

##### A few resources I referred to:

- [Redux docs "Usage with TypeScript"](https://redux.js.org/recipes/usage-with-typescript)
- [`TypeScript-React-Start` docs](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter#typescript-react-starter)

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
